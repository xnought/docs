Explaining Model Quantization from first principles with interactive visualizations. Large models can't fit on your computer. Go do something about it.

## My Plan

-   [ ] Explain the problem as fundamentally and simply as possible
-   [ ] K-means quantization
    -   [ ] intuitive example with image
    -   [ ] build up for how to pick the values
    -   [ ] take an autoencoder that reconstructs pixel art
    -   [ ] show errors for different amounts of quantization
    -   [ ] scale up to stable diffusion quantization
    -   [ ] connect to information theoretic standpoint

## Why?
